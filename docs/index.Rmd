## Introduction

In [this](https://github.com/fendit/MultipleLinearRegressionTableWithStargazer) Github repository, I present a method to combine results of multiple linear regressions in a Latex regression table with [stargazer](stargazer) (R package).

The aim is to simplify regressions generation processes with user-defined set of Independent Variables (IVs) for each regression model and show all results in a regression table with stargazer. This is very helpful when adding (or removing) new IVs in current equation gradually.

## Loading package

```{r results='hide'}
library(stargazer)
```

## Function

I created a function called `Regress` for combining results of all regression models into a single table:

```{r}
Regress <- function(data, DV, eq.IVs, OutcomeLabel){
  
  equations <- paste0(DV, " ~ ", eq.IVs) # Create equations 
  RegResults <- list()  # Create an empty list that stores all regression results
  LogLike <- c("Log Likelihood")  # Storing log-likelihood of all regression results
  
  for(i in 1:length(equations)){
    reg <- lm(formula = equations[i], data = data)
    reg$AIC <- AIC(reg) # Include Akaike Inf. Crit.
    reg$BIC <- BIC(reg) # Include Bayesian Inf. Crit.
    RegResults[[paste0(OutcomeLabel, "_", ifelse(i<10, paste0(0, i), i))]] <- reg
    LogLike <- append(x = LogLike, values = round(logLik(reg),2))
  }
  
  # Export RegResults as doc 
  return(stargazer(RegResults, 
            type = 'html', 
            out = paste0("Regression_Results_", OutcomeLabel, ".doc"), add.lines = list(LogLike))
         )
}
```

This function `Regress` contains multiple inputs:

-   `data` for the set of data used in multiple linear regression models

-   `DV` refers to dependent variable of multiple linear regression models

-   `eq.IVs` refers to set of IVs in each multiple linear regression model

-   `OutcomeLabel` refers to the document name of the outcome (user-defined)

Note that this function also includes model results of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Log likelihood (LogLike) for models comparison.

This function returns with the regression table results in word document format.

## Examples

Here [npk](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/npk.html) (R Datasets) is used for illustration. Three regressions are generated using `lm()`, with `yield` as dependent variable, as well as `block` and `N` as independent variables.

First we import the dataset:

```{r}
npk <- datasets::npk # Using R Datasets (Classical N, P, K Factorial Experiment)
```

We then define the dependent variable, which is `yield` in this case:

```{r}
DV = 'yield'  # Set dependent variable
```

Next, we define the set of IVs in each regression model. The first equation has `block` as IV. The second one has `N`. The last one has both as IVs:

```{r}
# Create a list of equations with independent variables
# Here 1st equation is block, 2nd with N, 3rd with block and N
eq.IVs <- c("block",
            'N',
            'block + N'
            )

```

Then we generate the regression table with the function `Regress`:

```{r results='hide'}
RegressionTable <- Regress(data = npk, DV = DV, eq.IVs = eq.IVs, OutcomeLabel = "NPK")
```

The result looks like this (here I use `htmltools` package for showing the result, but it is saved as a .doc file in the current working directory once the function is executed):

```{r}
htmltools::knit_print.html(RegressionTable)
```

<br>

The complete code is shown as follows:

```{r results='hide'}
npk <- datasets::npk # Using R Datasets (Classical N, P, K Factorial Experiment)
DV = 'yield'  # Set dependent variable
# Create a list of equations with independent variables
# Here 1st equation is block, 2nd with N, 3rd with block and N
eq.IVs <- c("block",
            'N',
            'block + N'
            )
RegressionTable <- Regress(data = npk, DV = DV, eq.IVs = eq.IVs, OutcomeLabel = "NPK")
```
